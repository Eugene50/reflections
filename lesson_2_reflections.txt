How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

     staging it is a prepareing zone for future commits, and i can check once more my files before the final commiting.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

     i think that i can to use the command git diff --staged (show`s diff between staging and most recent commit) after  some time, and to compare which changes more logical and change them, or commiting.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

     the opportunity to create a new branches is very helpful, because when i don`t want to mix my experiment with the main line of project, i can go to the new branche and make there what i want. Branches it`s like a bookcase, when all my projects are arrange.
