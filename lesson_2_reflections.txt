What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

     when i initialize a new repo, was createad empty repo, and i can start to staff with files my repo!


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

     staging it is a prepareing zone for future commits, and i can check once more my files before the final commiting.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

     i think that i can to use the command git diff --staged (show`s diff between staging and most recent commit) after  some time, and to compare which changes more logical and change them, or commiting.
