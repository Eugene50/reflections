When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   Acctualy when i want to share their work with another people, and when my location is so far from my local working place 
   i have accses to my basic files of work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  i think that very important to choose manualy what kind of files i want to up to date on my local workspace, and sometimes  i don`t want that git has auto coonecting to my remote repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is a like a clone of the website repo, in the same time clone is a copy of this repo to your own computer, and branches is a result of your new ideas for improvement some files in this repo.
  When i want to modify some  parts  of code or add new features to  the main file, i try to use new branche, what would not spoil the project.
  Clone usually i use when i want to get all files from repo to my computer. 
  And fork i use when i want to have interesting me project in my website version of GitHub.
