How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  The old and new lines of code where was a difference i saw near each other, it was very quick to juxtapose


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    i think it is fantastic, when i was back to the initial file  and start develop new way, besides i can to compare files and trace the thought
of developers? to understanding what they mean

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

The most good thing for the automatically save it`s a needlees every time to thinck about saving your process-very comfortable,
on the other hand when i will use manualy i feel free to create a commit in the most logical time create him.

    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because this way more productive for collective job, every one can see changes in files  at once. I think that Git give more flexebility specially for developer teams.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    it is so easy to get the history of files, just write command git log, and i see the list of changed files.
    command git diff  give me the good opportunity to compare different files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    before start working i can to checkout some comits for bugs, and be  shure that my start point without bugs.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to try to get  an experience in a teamwork, and really want to check all features of git
    
 anyway i want to try everything! and more!!!!!
